**Mixology**    
Challenging the barriers encountered by artists of colour exploring Live Art. A group meal + discussion, with guest Tarik Elmoutawakil.

In May 2014, we invited a diverse group of artists to come together for a meal, a glass of wine and a conversation about Live Art and cultural diversity. And so, Divergency was born…         
         
A gathering of like-minded people, over the last 2 years we have eaten (plenty), drunk (even more) and talked, sometimes even argued (too much). We've also done workshops, seen and put-on performances and sown the seeds for a new crop of work.     
          
Now we'd like to mix things up — and we'd like to invite you to join us in exploring, talking, watching, and making Live Art. There'll be food, there'll be talk, there'll be a bit of performance — and we might even be mixing our drinks…          
          
**About Tarik Elmoutawakil**         
Tarik Elmoutawakil is an artist, programmer, and community organiser based at <a href="http://www.marlboroughtheatre.org.uk" target="_blank">The Marlborough Theatre</a> in Brighton UK since 2008. His recent public work is entitled 'Brownton Abbey', an Afro-Futures Performance Party that centres QTIPOC (queer, trans and intersex people of colour), in particular those with disabilities. Drawing on the divine energies of QTIPOC, Brownton Abbey reclaims and reinterprets QTIPOC spirituality and ritual, channelling it into an out-of-this-world party.          

Tarik is fixated on themes of queer resistance, harnessing the elevation, celebration, and centring of Otherness. He is currently investigating the transformational power of both radically inclusive and radically exclusive spaces as modes of empowerment and social cohesion. Tarik is a keen public speaker on subjects such as ‘Tokenism’ and ‘Learning to Talk about Race’, and is invested in connecting connecting collectives, and amplifying the voices of marginalised people whose perspectives are usually unheard.
