**Workshop: Approaches to Critical Writing**    
How can artists and audiences sidestep the star rating format to give meaningful critical responses to watching performance? A workshop lead by Salome Wagaine.        

This workshop is intended for artists and audiences looking to try out new ways of expressing joy, tedium, or something else entirely after watching a performance. Focussing on criticism that sits outside the star rating reviews format, the session will explore approaching critical writing in a way that makes room for the social context in which any show is made, through a combination of discussion and exercises.
