Nikky Norton is a poet and performance artist with a strange ambition to become a storybook.     

She takes inspiration from everyday experiences and interactions to inform where she should go next to achieve her transformation.    

At present she creates bedtime stories and delivers magical story experiences in interesting spaces – chocolate boutiques, libraries and secret gardens.    

#### *Inside Story*                
This is the initial stage of exploring what it might look like to create a musical theatre experience taking inspiration from storybook aesthetics. The idea was to start to explore how visual imagery and costume could take the audience on a journey of transformation.
