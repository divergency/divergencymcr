#### *Becoming Storybook*                
My name is Nikky. I am a little bit strange...    
I want to become a Storybook.    
On my 30th birthday in 2015 I decided to create my own job title.    
JOB TITLE:  Storybook    
There you go. See.    
Erm but I wasn't too sure what to do or where to start...    
And so the adventure began trying and failing to become a book. I like the idea of entering the unknown...
