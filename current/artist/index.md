Divergency is an informal network, supporting a small group of culturally diverse artists to explore live art in their practice. Bringing together both new artists and those experienced in different artforms, Divergency is a year-round programme of exploring and making, watching and talking.        

We meet, we talk, we eat (often), we see work and we explore — through a series of workshops led by both the group and invited guest artists.        

So far, Divergency has seed-funded seven early stage works, shown at various stages of development in [October 2016](/current/2016/6oct) – their development continues…        

Divergency was established in 2014 in response to a Creative Case North residency investigating under-representation in Live Art and is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England and by hÅb and STUN.        

Divergency welcomes new members, so if you'd like to know more contact: <mailto:divergency@habmcr.org>
