What are the real laws of attraction?         
         
Unlikely bed-fellows quantum mechanics, existentialism and erotic dance combine in this celebration of female sensuality from a feminist perspective.
         
"People assume that people lap-dance just because they really need the money and have no other options, through circumstance or education. So, as quite a bookish, published poet, why on earth did I decide to do a lap-dancing course? The truth is I absolutely fell in love with it as a performance style and means of self-expression. This led me to think about my body as a black woman and how I can find ways of exploring the ownership of it, and I came up with the central question of 'how is a black woman's sex like quantum mechanics and existentialism?' This is my attempt to answer it…"
