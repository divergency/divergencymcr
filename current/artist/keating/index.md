Jamil E-R Keating is a theatre-maker, writer and performer. *Asteroid RK1* is his fourth piece of work, the fourth step in an artistic journey of trying to find the balance between being overwhelmed by a perverse enthusiasm for the absurdity of life, and trying to say something of substance about it… simply.           
         
To date he has made small pieces for Hazard (as Tracey Lumpkin) and Emergency, received a Works Ahead commission from hÅb + Contact, collaborated as dramaturg on a performance at The Royal Exchange, assistant directed for Contact, curated performances at Manchester Art Gallery and been an emerging artist in residence at the Whitworth.

Rotations, revolutions, realisations…

An allegorical installation-performance about outer-space and our inner-city streets. Asteroids and addictions. Meteorites and human rights. Comets in the night sky and care in the city.    

This is an early work-in-development piece, after roughly a month of writing and research about the issues of homelessness in Manchester. Jamil worked with a theatre group at the Mustard Tree consisting of men who have slept rough on the streets.  He would like to continue to develop the work in conjunction with homeless people and aims to present it on the streets of Manchester for a homeless audience. He is due to develop the work over 2017, with the commissioning and presenting as part of SICK! Festival and Works Ahead.       
         
Developed as a Divergency micro-commission with support from hÅb + STUN (Sustained Theatre Up North).
