### MIXOLOGY
     
##  Thursday 19 January 2017, evening<br>STUN Studio at Z-arts   

In May 2014, we invited a diverse group of artists to come together for a meal, a glass of wine and a conversation about Live Art and cultural diversity. And so, Divergency was born… 

A gathering of like-minded people, over the last 2 years we have eaten (plenty), drunk (even more) and talked, sometimes even argued (too much).  We’ve also done workshops, seen and put-on performances and sown the seeds for a new crop of work, which we showed together on [ 6 Oct 2016](/current/2016/6oct)

In 2017 we’d like to mix things up - and we’d like to invite you to join us in exploring, talking, watching, and making Live Art. 

So - if you are a BAME artist, however experienced or emerging, with an interest in exploring Live Art then come along on 19 Jan 2017 to find out more.   

There’ll be food, there’ll be talk, there’ll be a bit of performance - and we might even be mixing our drinks…

If you’re interested in joining us - and so we can get an idea on numbers for food - please RSVP  to divergency@habmcr.org
