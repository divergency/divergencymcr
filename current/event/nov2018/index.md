**Workshop: Afrofuturism**    
A movement workshop looking at afro-diasporic dance and afrofuturism. Using ritualistic movement and rhythm, participants will explore how this can create transcendental experiences and performances. There will also be a provocation around futuristic fantasy and creating a persona of your future self, or design a new future. The workshop joins the inner life of the imagination and ancestry with the outer life of being present in the space.
