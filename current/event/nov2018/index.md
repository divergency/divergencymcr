**Live Art Workshop: *Killing Time***    
Do you kill your creative ideas before theyâ€™re born? Do you notice that the more time you have, the less you get done? Are you constantly getting in your own way?      

Introducing *Killing Time*!     
This workshop that galvanizes participants to:      
Move faster than think    
Create faster than critique      
Resist resistance      
Pulverize procrastination.    

*Killing Time* is a physical workshop that welcomes anyone who is curious about live art and performance. One must have a willingness to try out new ideas and an adventurous spirit to walk out into the unknown.
