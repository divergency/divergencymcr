### when in 2018 | STUN Studio at Z-arts     
           
In May 2014, we invited a diverse group of artists to come together for a meal, a glass of wine and a conversation about Live Art and cultural diversity. And so, Divergency was born…         
         
A gathering of like-minded people, over the last 2 years we have eaten (plenty), drunk (even more) and talked, sometimes even argued (too much). We've also done workshops, seen and put-on performances and sown the seeds for a new crop of work, which we showed together on [6 Oct 2016](/archive/event/showcase2016)         
          
In 2017 we'd like to mix things up — and we'd like to invite you to join us in exploring, talking, watching, and making Live Art. There'll be food, there'll be talk, there'll be a bit of performance — and we might even be mixing our drinks…          
         
So — if you are a BAME artist, however experienced or emerging, with an interest in exploring Live Art, we would love for you to join us.           
             
So we can get an idea on numbers for food, and names, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/mixology-2017-tickets-32231126166" target="_blank">please book your free space here</a>, or email us at <mailto:divergency@habmcr.org> and let us know a little something about yourself…

Now that it's over, see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2017-mixology) from the event.
